      4. A difficulty level ('Easy', 'Medium', or 'Hard')
      5. Step-by-step cooking instructions written in your personality style
      6. Accurate calorie count per serving (e.g., "320 calories")

         - Fat content (e.g., "12g")

         - Sodium content (e.g., "450mg")
      9. Prep time (e.g., "10 minutes") - Time for chopping, measuring, marinating
      10. Cook time (e.g., "20 minutes") - Actual cooking/baking time
      11. Chef personality tips specific to your cooking style (personalityTips array)
      
      CRITICAL TIMING RULES:
      - Prep time + Cook time should approximately equal Total cooking time
      - Keep times realistic (most home recipes are 15-60 minutes total)
      - Don't use extremely long times unless it's a slow-cook recipe that explicitly requires it
      - Be consistent: if total time is "30 minutes", prep + cook should add up to around 30 minutes
      
      Calculate nutritional values based on standard ingredient nutritional data and typical serving sizes.
      Be accurate with calorie calculations considering cooking methods and portion sizes.
      Write instructions and tips that reflect your chef personality throughout.

        SERVING SIZE CONSIDERATIONS:
        ${recipesInfo.some(r => r.servingAdjustment !== 1) ? `
        ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Some recipes have been adjusted for different serving sizes:
        ${recipesInfo.filter(r => r.servingAdjustment !== 1).map(r => 
            `- ${r.name}: ${r.servingAdjustment}x servings (${r.servingSize})`
        ).join('\n        ')}
        
        When creating the schedule, account for these serving adjustments:
        - Larger serving sizes (>2x) may need extra prep time for chopping/mixing
        - Larger portions may require bigger pots/pans and longer cooking times
        - Multiple smaller batches might be needed if equipment is limited
        - Adjust ingredient prep times proportionally to serving size changes
        - Consider if cooking in batches is more efficient than one large batch
        ` : 'All recipes are at their original serving sizes.'}
        
        CREATE AN OPTIMIZED COOKING SCHEDULE that:
        1. Minimizes total cooking time through parallel preparation
        2. Reduces kitchen downtime (e.g., start marinating while prep continues)
        3. Coordinates multiple dishes to finish simultaneously or in logical sequence
        4. Considers equipment limitations (only one oven, limited stovetop space)
        5. Accounts for skill level and provides appropriate guidance
        6. RESPECTS SERVING SIZE ADJUSTMENTS: Factor in extra prep/cook time for larger portions
        7. USES REALISTIC TIMING: If a recipe says prep 15min + cook 20min, don't schedule it for 4 hours
        8. RESPECTS PREFERRED SERVING TIME: If user wants food ready at specific time, calculate backwards
        
        TIMING CALCULATION RULES:
        - Start with the user's preferred serving time and work backwards
        - Account for actual prep and cook times from each recipe
        - Add buffer time for coordination (5-10 minutes)
        - For recipes with serving adjustments >1.5x, add 20-30% more prep time
        - For recipes with serving adjustments <0.8x, may reduce prep time by 10-15%
        - Total schedule time should be reasonable (usually 30 minutes to 2 hours max)
        - If no serving time specified, assume user wants to start cooking now
        6. Uses realistic timing - no steps shorter than 2 minutes, most steps 5-15 minutes
        7. Provides clear, actionable descriptions for each step
        
        TIMING GUIDELINES:
        - Prep steps: typically 5-15 minutes each
        - Active cooking: 3-20 minutes depending on technique
        - Passive cooking: 10-60 minutes (baking, simmering, etc.)
        - Start times should be multiples of 5 minutes for clarity
        - Build in buffer time between critical steps
        
        STEP TYPES:
        - "prep": Chopping, measuring, marinating (can be done in parallel)
        - "active": Requires constant attention (stirring, sautéing)
        - "passive": Hands-off cooking (baking, simmering, marinating)
        
        PRIORITY LEVELS:
        - "high": Critical timing, cannot be delayed
        - "medium": Some flexibility in timing
        - "low": Can be done whenever convenient
        
        For each step, provide:
        - Unique ID (step1, step2, etc.)
        - Recipe ID (recipe1, recipe2, etc.)
        - Clear, actionable step description
        - Start time in minutes from cooking start (0 = begin immediately)
        - Duration in minutes
        - Step type and priority
        - Required equipment if specific
        - Pro tips for efficiency
        
        Calculate realistic timing based on:
        - Prep work that can be done simultaneously
        - Cooking processes that can overlap
        - Rest/wait times that allow other tasks
        - Realistic multitasking for the given skill level
        
        Provide efficiency tips and a summary timeline that explains the cooking flow.

        RECIPE REINVENTION CHALLENGE: Take the classic dish "${request.dishName}" and completely reinvent it with your chef personality!
        
        Your task is to create 3 innovative versions of "${request.dishName}" that:
        1. Keep the essence and recognizable elements of the original dish
        2. Add your unique chef personality twist and creativity
        3. Use modern techniques, interesting ingredient swaps, or presentation styles
        4. Maintain the spirit of "${request.dishName}" while making it distinctly YOUR creation
        
        Dietary preference: ${request.dietaryPreference || 'no specific preference'}${exclusionText}${flavorText}${styleText}
        
        For each reinvented recipe, provide:
        1. A creative new name that shows it's an innovative version of "${request.dishName}"
        2. Complete ingredient list with quantities (reinvented but recognizable)
        3. Total cooking time (realistic: prep time + cook time)
        4. Difficulty level ('Easy', 'Medium', or 'Hard')
        5. Step-by-step instructions that reflect your chef personality
        6. Accurate calorie count per serving
        7. Serving size information
        8. Detailed nutritional breakdown per serving
        9. Prep time and cook time that add up to total time
        10. Personality tips that explain your reinvention approach
